Hello! As your certified nutritionist and fitness expert, I'm excited to help you achieve your muscle gain goals. Based on your profile, we'll create a comprehensive and practical plan to fuel your progress.

## 7-Day Muscle Gain Diet Plan for You!

### Daily Caloric Target

First, let's calculate your estimated daily caloric needs for muscle gain.

*   **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):** Using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation (which is generally considered accurate):
    BMR = (10 * weight in kg) + (6.25 * height in cm) - (5 * age in years) + 5
    BMR = (10 * 61) + (6.25 * 178) - (5 * 21) + 5
    BMR = 610 + 1112.5 - 105 + 5
    **BMR ≈ 1622.5 kcal**

*   **Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE):** We'll multiply your BMR by an activity factor. For "Lightly Active" (exercises 1-3 days/week), the factor is typically 1.375.
    TDEE = BMR * Activity Factor
    TDEE = 1622.5 * 1.375
    **TDEE ≈ 2231 kcal**

*   **Caloric Target for Muscle Gain:** To gain muscle, you need a caloric surplus. A moderate surplus of 300-500 kcal is generally recommended to promote muscle growth while minimizing excessive fat gain.
    **Target Caloric Intake ≈ 2231 + 400 = 2631 kcal**

    For simplicity and to ensure you're consistently in a surplus, we'll aim for approximately **2600-2700 kcal per day**.

### Macronutrient Breakdown

For muscle gain, we'll prioritize protein intake and ensure adequate carbohydrates for energy and recovery, with healthy fats for hormonal support.

*   **Protein:** Crucial for muscle repair and growth. Aim for 1.6-2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.
    *   Let's aim for 2.0 g/kg: 61 kg * 2.0 g/kg = 122 g
    *   Calories from protein: 122 g * 4 kcal/g = 488 kcal
    *   Percentage of total calories: (488 / 2650) * 100% ≈ **18%**

*   **Fats:** Essential for hormone production and overall health. Aim for 20-30% of total calories.
    *   Let's aim for 25%: 2650 kcal * 0.25 = 662.5 kcal
    *   Grams of fat: 662.5 kcal / 9 kcal/g ≈ **74 g**

*   **Carbohydrates:** Provide energy for your workouts and replenish glycogen stores. The remaining calories will come from carbs.
    *   Calories from carbs: 2650 kcal - 488 kcal (protein) - 662.5 kcal (fats) = 1500 kcal
    *   Grams of carbs: 1500 kcal / 4 kcal/g = **375 g**

**Therefore, your daily macronutrient targets are approximately:**

*   **Protein: 120-130 g**
*   **Fats: 70-80 g**
*   **Carbohydrates: 360-380 g**

### Day-wise Meal Plan (Day 1-7)

This plan is designed to be practical, affordable, and easy to follow with common non-vegetarian ingredients. Portion sizes are estimates and can be adjusted slightly based on your hunger and energy levels.

### Snack Options

Choose 2-3 of these to supplement your meals as needed, focusing on protein and healthy fats to keep you full and aid recovery.

1.  **Greek Yogurt (full-fat) with Berries and Nuts:** (~200-250 kcal)
2.  **Hard-Boiled Eggs (2) with an Apple:** (~200-250 kcal)
3.  **Cottage Cheese (full-fat) with Fruit:** (~150-200 kcal)
4.  **Whey Protein Shake:** (~150-200 kcal)
5.  **Handful of Nuts (Almonds, Walnuts, Cashews):** (~150-200 kcal)
6.  **Tuna Pouch with Whole Wheat Crackers:** (~200-250 kcal)

### Hydration Guidelines

*   **Water Intake:** Aim for at least **3-4 liters of water per day**. This is crucial for overall health, nutrient transport, and performance.
*   **When to Drink:** Sip water consistently throughout the day. Drink a glass of water upon waking, before meals, and during/after workouts.
*   **Other Fluids:** Unsweetened tea and coffee are also acceptable. Limit sugary drinks and excessive fruit juices.

### Meal Timing

*   **Consistency is Key:** Try to eat your meals at roughly the same times each day to regulate your metabolism and energy levels.
*   **Pre-Workout:** Consume a meal or snack containing carbohydrates and some protein 1-2 hours before your workout for energy.
*   **Post-Workout:** Within 1-2 hours after your workout, aim for a meal or snack rich in protein and carbohydrates to aid muscle recovery and glycogen replenishment. The "Pre-Dinner Snack/Post-Workout" slot is designed for this.
*   **Before Bed:** A slow-digesting protein source like cottage cheese or a casein protein shake can be beneficial for muscle repair overnight.

### General Nutrition Tips for Muscle Gain

1.  **Prioritize Protein at Every Meal:** Ensure each of your 5 meals includes a good source of protein (meat, fish, eggs, dairy, protein powder). This consistent supply of amino acids is vital for muscle protein synthesis.
2.  **Don't Fear Healthy Fats:** Incorporate sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil. These fats are important for hormone production, which directly impacts muscle growth and recovery.
3.  **Focus on Whole, Unprocessed Foods:** Build your diet around lean proteins, complex carbohydrates (oats, brown rice, sweet potatoes, whole grains), fruits, and vegetables. These provide essential micronutrients and fiber.
4.  **Listen to Your Body:** While this plan provides a great framework, pay attention to your hunger cues. If you're genuinely hungry between meals, a healthy snack is appropriate. If you're feeling overly full, you can slightly reduce portion sizes.
5.  **Be Patient and Consistent:** Muscle gain is a gradual process. Stick to your diet and training plan consistently, and you will see results over time.

### Supplement Suggestions

While a whole-food diet is paramount, these supplements can offer additional support for your muscle gain goals:

1.  **Whey Protein Powder:** Excellent for post-workout recovery and convenient for hitting protein targets. Choose a high-quality brand.
2.  **Creatine Monohydrate:** One of the most researched and effective supplements for increasing strength, power, and muscle mass. Start with a loading phase (optional) or simply take 3-5g daily.
3.  **Multivitamin:** To ensure you're covering all your micronutrient bases, especially when increasing caloric intake.

**Important Note:** This plan is a general guideline. Your individual needs may vary. If you experience any digestive issues or have concerns, consult with a registered dietitian or healthcare professional.

Enjoy your journey to muscle gain! You've got this!
